## Task:

Classify objects using the K-means algorithm. The result of the work should be presented graphically.

## K-means algorithm

**The input data** is the number of objects and classes into which we want to divide the objects.

**The goal and result of the algorithm** is to determine by the kernels of classes K the typical representatives of classes and to maximally compactly distribute the remaining objects of the sample around them.
