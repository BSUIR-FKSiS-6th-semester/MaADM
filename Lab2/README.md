## Task:

Classify objects using the Maximin algorithm. The result of the work should be presented graphically.

## Maximin algorithm

**Initial data** - the number of images to be divided into classes.

**The goal and result of the algorithm** is to divide objects into classes as compactly as possible based on arbitrary choice, by defining the kernel of each class.
